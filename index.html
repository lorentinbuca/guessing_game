The inception of the European automotive industry is traced back to the late 19th century when it first arose in Germany and France. Now it has become one of the leading branches of all the industrial sectors. And statistical data prove it: European car industry comprises 6.9% of EU GDP; it makes the trade surplus of 95.7 billion euro and provides employment for 12.9 million people who work in about 290 assembly and production facilities in 25 European countries. It worth saying that 22% of all passenger cars (14.6 million units) are produced in the European Union.</p>
